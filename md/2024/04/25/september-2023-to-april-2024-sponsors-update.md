# Satisfactory Community Highlights Archive
* Finally caught up with the backlog of VOD archives
* added creator names to content creator highlights page
* added progress bar indicating progress of downloading search data

# Satisfactory Clips Archive
* Experimented with adding Shorts, found the time required to create them vs. level of engagement makes them not worth regularly posting.

# [Docs.json.ts](https://github.com/Satisfactory-Clips-Archive/Docs.json.ts)
* Started back in February 2024, finally started working in earnest on a production calculator
* Docs.json.ts is currently an npm package that ingests the Satisfactory Docs.json file & uses code generation to create TypeScript bindings for the types & data found therein, which should be useful for myself and others in the creation of Satisfactory-related tools.

# Misc.
* finally posted this update
