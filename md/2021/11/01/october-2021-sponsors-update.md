# Satisfactory Clips Archive

## General Updates
* In the intervening weeks where I was without my personal computer, it seems the server had a slight snafu & required a restoration from backup. Tech support advised a server upgrade due to the snafu likely to occur again in future (if left unmonitored for over a month), but I'll be putting that off, pending amongst other things [dockerisation of the build step](https://github.com/Satisfactory-Clips-Archive/Media-Search-Archive/issues/8).
	* Restoration of the backup did not restore the timezone & led to some updates not being uploaded, this has
	* Reinstalled fonts for local image generationsince been fixed.
* Recategorised some of the Buildables clips into separate topics.
* Recategorised some of the Build Modes clips into separate topics.
* Updated playlists & descriptions for old videos

	* corrected docs for Jace's 2017 intro video based on incorrectly formatted data being flagged by the tool
* moved array reversal to avoid cache expiry on recently-added clips
* added tool to aid in the identification of clips that can be tracked with native YouTube clips instead of embed links
