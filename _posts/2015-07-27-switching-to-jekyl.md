summary: So I've decided to migrate my blog from PHP/WordPress to Jekyl.
---
I've not updated my blog in quite a while, & thought it was better to start
  anew with a new design/blog platform as a learning experience. So this new
  design is [Jekyl-based](https://jekyllrb.com/); I had tried to get a site
  working with Metalsmith but couldn't get my head around it :s

Since this is a static site,
  [I've decided to use Disqus to facilitate comments](
    https://disqus.com/home/forums/signpostmarv-blog/
  ).

I'm also taking the rather lazy option of not migrating all the content at
  once- I'd like to fine-tune the markdown in my posts
  (rewriting code samples for example),
  and some of it I'm just not all that fussed about archiving. If anyone wants
  anything to jump ahead in the queue of what I migrate over, the
  [404 error page](404.html) comments thread will be used to track requests.

If prompted, I may blog further about the process/decision of migrating away
  from PHP/WordPress-based sites.
