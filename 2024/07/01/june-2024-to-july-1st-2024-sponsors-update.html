Repo / NPM Package Updates</h1><p>
Existing packages that weren't directly-related to the Satisfactory Clips Archive or Community Highlights Archive were shifted over to satisfactory.dev so that it was clear which work was archive-related and which was generally satisfactory-related.
</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/satisfactory-dev">GitHub</a></li><li><a
 href="https://www.npmjs.com/settings/satisfactory-dev/packages">NPM</a></li>
<li><a href="https://satisfactory.dev/">Web</a></li></ul><p>
The GitHub reorganisation also meant that all the relevant repos now show up on 
<a href="https://github.com/orgs/satisfactory-dev/projects/1">
one project planner</a>
 instead of having one in my personal GitHub space separate from the different specific GitHub organisations.

SignpostMarv/Satisfactory-Production-Calculator-UI</a></h2><ul><li>
not made open source, repo is issues only. This is similar to SCIM's source <a 
href="https://github.com/AnthorNet/SC-InteractiveMap/commit/ca243cad8b95b0c834fed07763696ba6fa9081f1">
not being open</a>
, except with the calculator's UI source repo not being public.</li><li>
names of pools, groups, and collections are now context-dependant (id number will only be appended in contexts where collisions are relevant)
</li><li>
example save files can now be opened into the json document loading dialog, allowing them to be viewed/edited before being loaded.
</li><li>production pools/names now featured in relevant dialogs</li><li>
toggle for auto-following the current pool (affects state of sidebar)</li><li>
<s>auto-upgrade of JSON Documents from older versions to current version</s>
 legacy version support dropped, auto-upgrade will still be employed in future updates.
<ul><li>
example save files don't need to be updated in order to continue to be used
</li></ul></li><li>
new save has a default pool, document loader supports poolless documents</li>
<li>migrated to <a 
href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@satisfactory-dev/docs.json.ts-production-planner">
npm package</a> rather than using the repo as a git submodule.</li></ul><h3>
Reports</h3><ul><li>consistent sort order for report views</li><li>
different sections of the report views highlighted to try and avoid change blindness when scrolling
</li></ul><h3>Recipe Selections</h3><ul><li>
recipe selections now able to be set at the global, collection, and group levels in addition to the pool-level recipe selections.
</li><li>recipe selection items can be removed</li><li>
recipe selections can be cloned from other pools before being customised</li>
<li>toggle to defer recalculation until after recipe selection dialog closed
</li><li>added recipe ingredient icons to recipe selection dialogs</li></ul>
<h3>Production Flinging</h3><ul><li>
sort order now able to be changed without editing the JSON document</li><li>
undesired behaviour where zero-amount items would be filtered from production flinging fixed
</li><li>
entries now able to be deleted (previously stuck with either editing the JSON document or setting output amount to zero)
</li><li>
input items now able to be used as production flinging sources, meaning pools can function as being equivalent to redistribution floors
</li><li>
breadcrumb trail for destination added to dialog to avoid inadvertently adding the wrong pool as a destination (re: duplicate names)
